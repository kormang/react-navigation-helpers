 Action creator for most common reset action when nested navigators are present.
 Sets index to 0, and key to null. Resets to `rootRouteName` (which must be part of root navigator).
 Then it executes navigate action which navigates to nested route with name `nestedRouteName`.
 After that arbitrary additionalActions will be executed.
 Currying is used because often we use same `rootRouteName`, so we can easily
 make specialized function without need to create wrapper.

 Action creator for action that will restore navigation state to some previous preserved state.
 It is useful when you would like to return to screen from which (for example) user went to Login screen.
 If you save navigation state from redux store you can pass it to this action creator as state,

 It is also performance and memory optimization,
 as with resetting to desired state would create new screens,
 and the unmount and delete old screens. This will preserve screens.
