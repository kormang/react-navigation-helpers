/*
 Selector for custom configurations and options. Result of a curry chain is selector function,
 which means it accepts redux state.
 Traverses navigation tree and collects options from route configuration, navigators,
 components and state params.
 In each of places where you can define options, you can define them as
 function returning object or as object it self.
 These functions or objects should be named as provided `optionsName`.
 There is four places where you can define custom options.
 These are ordered according to precedence
 (first will be merged into result first, so it has lower precedence,
 and can be overwritten by others).

 1. As static member of navigator or component.
 2. Inside navigator config, e.g. `StackNavigator(routeConfig, { statusBarOptions: {} })`.
 3. Inside routes config, e.g. `StackNavigator({ statusBarOptions: {} }, navigatorConfig)`.
 4. Inside navigation params, e.g. `navigation.state.params.statusBarOptions`.
 It will have effect only if it is present in leaf component of navigation tree.
